Character | Text
--- | ---
**Curly** | Each night, you learn how many votes were cast by non-Townsfolk today.
**Darling** | You start knowing 1 Outsider character in play. Each night, you learn how many seats the Clockhand is away from that Outsider. [Minimum 1 Outsider]
**Liza** | While you are alive, the Storyteller might not collect vote tokens from dead good players who voted (after their votes have been counted.)
**Nibs** | If you die at night, you learn how many seats the Clockhand is away from the Demon. 1 evil player knows that Nibs is in play.
**Pan** | Each night\*, choose a player: if good, they may trade seats with a player of their choosing. While the Clockhand is pointing to you, you cannot die.
**Slightly** | The first time you are nominated, if the nominator is not a Townsfolk, they are executed immediately.
**Tiger Lily** | Once per game, at night, choose a player (other than yourself): if they are not a Townsfolk, they die. While you are alive, you remain healthy and sober (e.g. Tiger Lily is immune to poison.)
**Tootles** | Each night, you learn how many Townsfolk are alive.
**Twins** | Each night\*, choose a player (different to last night): you learn that they are one of two types (Townsfolk, Outsider, Minion, Demon.)
**Watchdog** | Each night\*, select a player (other than yourself): if good, they are protected from the Demon, unless the Clockhand is pointing to them. If evil, they don't wake up tonight.

**Fairy** | The Clockhand skips you, and proceeds to your clockwise neighbor. Once per game, at night, name a character: if they are in play, and the player is dead, they are resurrected.
**Mermaids** | Each night\*, you may choose a player who is not one of your neighbors: they trade seats to be one seat nearer to you.
**Rooster** | The first time an Outsider dies, you gain their ability. If Pan is in play, and dies, you become Pan, and gain their ability (and therefore will no longer gain an Outsider ability as Rooster.) [+1 Outsider]
